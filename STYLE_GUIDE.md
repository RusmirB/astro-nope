# AstroNope Excuse Generator — Style Guidelines

AstroNope messages are NOT horoscopes.
They are short, dry, slightly sarcastic cosmic excuses.

If a sentence sounds like an astrology article, it is WRONG.

---

## CORE IDENTITY

AstroNope is:

- a refusal
- a boundary
- a cosmic shrug

AstroNope is NOT:

- advice
- guidance
- explanation
- spiritual coaching

The universe is blamed.
The user is protected.
No further questions.

---

## MESSAGE STRUCTURE (STRICT)

Each message MUST:

- Express a clear **NO / NOT TODAY**
- Blame a **cosmic cause**, not the user
- Be understandable without astrology knowledge
- Work as a standalone tweet / message

### Ideal length

- 6–16 words total
- Max 2 short sentences
- Prefer 1 sentence if possible

---

## ALLOWED COSMIC CONCEPTS ✅

Use only **pop-astrology language** that normal people recognize.

Safe concepts:

- universe
- stars
- moon
- mercury
- fate
- timing
- vibes
- energy (light use only)
- zodiac (as flavor, not explanation)
- numbers like 7, 11, 222, 444, 777
- cosmos
- cosmic
- astro (in casual sense)

Example:
✔️ "Not today. Mercury checked out."
✔️ "The universe needs a minute."
✔️ "Cosmic timing said no."

---

## FORBIDDEN TERMS ❌ (AUTO-REJECT)

Never use these technical astrology terms:

- transits
- aspects
- houses
- alignments
- retrogradation mechanics
- precession
- nutation
- axial tilt
- frequencies
- vibrations
- life path explanations
- spiritual jargon
- planetary positions
- conjunctions (except casual "together")
- sextiles
- squares (in astrology sense)

If the sentence needs explanation → discard it.

BAD:
❌ "Transits are heavy."
❌ "Planetary aspects are intense."
❌ "Energy alignment is off."

---

## TONE RULES

Tone must be:

- dry
- calm
- slightly sarcastic
- emotionally neutral
- self-aware
- humorous but understated

Avoid:

- drama
- teaching
- mysticism
- motivational language
- urgency
- over-explanation

BAD:
❌ "The universe is teaching you a lesson."
❌ "Trust the process."
❌ "URGENT: The cosmos demands action!"

GOOD:
✔️ "The universe said no."
✔️ "Not today. Try again tomorrow."
✔️ "Fate's got other plans."

---

## ZODIAC USAGE (CRITICAL)

Zodiac signs should:

- NEVER be blamed directly
- NEVER contradict the zodiac flavor tag
- Only appear as flavor/tone, not as cause

Zodiac = tone modifier, not reason for the NO.

### BAD ❌

- "Pisces is too emotional."
- "Scorpio ruined this."
- "Gemini is indecisive."
- "Leo is being dramatic."

### GOOD ✔️

- "Emotions are running the show. ✨ Pisces energy"
- "Boundaries are strong today. ✨ Scorpio energy"
- "Curiosity won this round. ✨ Gemini energy"
- "Confidence is the vibe. ✨ Leo energy"

If zodiac flavor is applied:

- Keep the main excuse generic (works for any sign)
- Add zodiac only as a label or subtle vibe reinforcement
- Message content should match the tone, not describe the sign

---

## HUMOR CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before accepting a message, ask:

1. **Would this work as a tweet?**
   - Short enough? Shareable? Single idea?
2. **Would someone screenshot this?**
   - Funny without explanation? Quotable?
3. **Does it feel effortless?**
   - No over-explaining? No preaching?
4. **Does it end the conversation?**
   - Is it a full, satisfying answer?

If the answer is not YES → reject and try again.

---

## FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

A valid AstroNope message must pass ALL:

- [ ] Has a clear refusal (no / not today / nope)
- [ ] Uses only simple cosmic language
- [ ] Avoids ALL astrology jargon (transits, aspects, etc.)
- [ ] Is understandable to someone who knows zero astrology
- [ ] Feels calm, not dramatic or preachy
- [ ] Is 6–16 words or max 2 sentences
- [ ] Would work as a standalone tweet
- [ ] Doesn't explain the excuse (just states it)
- [ ] Blames the universe, not the user or zodiac signs
- [ ] Ends the conversation (no open loops)

If unsure on any item → reject and regenerate.

## GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLES ⭐

✔️ "Not today. The universe needs a minute."
✔️ "Today's not it. It's written in the stars."
✔️ "The cosmos hit snooze."
✔️ "Fate said no further questions."
✔️ "Not today. Try again tomorrow."
✔️ "Mercury's on vacation."
✔️ "The moon agrees. Not now."
✔️ "Universe's vote: no."
✔️ "This is not the day."
✔️ "Timing's off. Ask again tomorrow."

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (WHAT FAILS) ❌

**Too long / explanatory:**

- "The planetary transits are creating a challenging energy that makes this not the right time."
- "Because of Mercury's retrograde cycle, communication is blocked."

**Too spiritual / preachy:**

- "This is a sign you need to trust the journey."
- "The universe is calling you to reflect."

**Blames the user:**

- "You're not ready."
- "Your energy is off."

**Blames the zodiac sign:**

- "Aries is too impulsive."
- "Pisces is too dreamy."

**Too sarcastic / mean:**

- "This is stupid."
- "Who even tries this?"

**Too vague:**

- "Things."
- "Nope."

---

## ONE SENTENCE RULE

If the generator is unsure:

> Output ONE short sentence with a clear NO.
>
> Silence (brevity) is better than explanation (wordiness).

**When in doubt:**

- Pick the shortest valid option
- Trust understatement
- Less is always more

---

## PROMPT FOR THE GENERATOR

Use this checklist when creating excuses:

1. Start with a refusal: "Not today.", "Today's not it.", "Nope."
2. Add ONE cosmic cause (universe, stars, fate, timing, etc.)
3. Keep it under 16 words
4. Read it aloud—does it sound natural?
5. Could it be a tweet? If no, shorten.
6. Does it need explanation? If yes, remove it.
7. Accept only if all checklist items pass ✅

## ZODIAC TONE MAPPING (OPTIONAL)

When zodiac flavor is applied, align the vibe:

| Zodiac      | Tone                 | Example                    |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Aries       | Bold, direct         | "Nope. Universe said no."  |
| Taurus      | Stubborn, steady     | "Not moving on this one."  |
| Gemini      | Curious, quick       | "Skipping this one."       |
| Cancer      | Protective, cautious | "Not safe right now."      |
| Leo         | Confident, proud     | "Not happening."           |
| Virgo       | Practical, precise   | "Wrong timing."            |
| Libra       | Balanced, diplomatic | "Not the right call."      |
| Scorpio     | Intense, boundaried  | "Hard no."                 |
| Sagittarius | Adventurous, free    | "Taking a different path." |
| Capricorn   | Serious, strategic   | "Not this time."           |
| Aquarius    | Detached, unique     | "The universe glitched."   |
| Pisces      | Intuitive, fluid     | "Energy says no."          |

Adapt the excuse to match the tone, but keep it universal.
