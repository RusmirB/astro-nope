## AstroNope Copy Guidelines

AstroNope is your cosmic no for today.
Not advice. Not astrology lessons. Just a confident refusal with cosmic backup.

**Core Identity:**
- Daily cosmic dismissal
- Planets/cosmos = the excuse mechanism
- Works with OR without zodiac selection
- Shareable, screenshot-worthy, final

**Tone:**
- Dry
- Short
- Confident
- Dismissive but funny
- Zero explanations or lessons

**If it sounds:**
- Polite → remove it
- Spiritual/motivational → remove it
- Like teaching astrology → remove it
- Like therapy → remove it
---

## MESSAGE ARCHITECTURE

Every AstroNope = 2 possible layers:

1. **CORE MESSAGE** (mandatory, daily, universal)
2. **ZODIAC FLAVOR** (optional personality overlay when sign selected)

Both must work independently.

---

## CORE MESSAGE RULES

**Purpose:** The daily cosmic no. Works for everyone.

**Structure:**

- Max 12 words total
- Format: `[Refusal]. [Cosmic excuse]. [Closer].`
- Sounds like a final verdict

**Cosmic Elements Allowed:**

- ✅ Planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, etc.)
- ✅ Celestial metaphors (servers down, alignment off, signal lost)
- ✅ Cosmic system language (constellation offline, orbit declined)
- ❌ Astrology lessons (explaining what retrograde means)
- ❌ Horoscope predictions (what will happen tomorrow)

**Examples:**

✅ **Good Core Messages:**

- "Hard pass. Celestial servers down. Emotionally."
- "Nope. Mercury filed a complaint. Done."
- "Skip. Mars clocked out early. Period."
- "Declined. Cosmic bandwidth depleted. Moving on."
- "Pass. Venus unavailable. Final."

❌ **Bad:**

- "Today is not ideal for you." (too polite, no cosmic element)
- "Mercury retrograde affects communication, so wait." (teaching + advice)
- "The universe wants you to rest." (spiritual motivation)

---

## ZODIAC FLAVOR RULES

**Purpose:** Personality twist. Only appears when user selects their sign.

**Requirements:**

- Max 6 words
- Amplifies the core's dismissal with sign personality
- Can reference sign traits (NOT planets)
- Never explains or educates

**Format:**

- Short cosmic shrug
- Personality label style
- No "because" or explanations

**Examples:**

✅ **Good Zodiac Flavors:**

- "Virgo energy. Overthinking denied."
- "Leo: main character offline."
- "Scorpio mode: classified."
- "Gemini brain: too many tabs."
- "Capricorn: schedule full. Forever."

❌ **Bad:**

- "Because Virgo tends to analyze everything..." (explanation)
- "Your sign suggests waiting until..." (prediction/advice)
- "Virgos are detail-oriented, so..." (astrology lesson)

---

## COMBINATION TEST

**Core alone** (no zodiac selected):

> "Hard pass. Celestial servers down. Emotionally."

✅ Works? Yes. Shareable, funny, final.

**Core + Zodiac** (sign selected):

> "Hard pass. Celestial servers down. Emotionally."  
> "Virgo energy. Overthinking denied."

✅ Works? Yes. Zodiac adds personality layer without breaking core.

**Rule:** If adding zodiac flavor makes it weird or repetitive, remove zodiac.

- [Planet name] + human verb (Mercury declined, Venus unavailable)

### ✅ Preferred (Zodiac Flavor)

- [Sign] energy/mode/brain

### ❌ Avoid

---

## SHARE TEST (FINAL CHECK)

Before approving any message, ask:

**1. Would someone screenshot this and send it to their group chat without embarrassment?**

**2. Does it work without context?**

**3. Does the cosmic element enhance the dismissal (not distract)?**

**4. If zodiac is added, does it complement (not repeat)?**

If any answer is NO → reject it.

---

## FORMULA SUMMARY

**Core Message:**  
`[Refusal]. [Cosmic excuse]. [Closer].`  
Max 12 words. Cosmic element = mechanism, not lesson.

**Zodiac Flavor (optional):**  
`[Sign] [personality trait]. [Dismissive punch].`  
Max 6 words. Personality amplifier.

**Combined Effect:**  
Confident cosmic no that's shareable, funny, and final.
