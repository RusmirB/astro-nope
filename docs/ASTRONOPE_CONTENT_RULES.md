# AstroNope Content Rules

AstroNope = **dismissive refusal generator**, not a horoscope.

## Core Identity

- **Refusal is the product; cosmos is the excuse.**
- Core reads like a final decision: short, dry, confident.
- Zodiac is an optional twist, never required.

---

## Core Message Rules (Mandatory)

### Structure

- **Max 12 words total**
- Format: `[Setup]. [Reason]. [Closer].`
- Sounds like a verdict that ends conversation

### Tone

- Dry > funny
- Confident > mystical
- Modern > spiritual

### Length per component

- Setup: 1–3 words (Pass. / Nope. / Skip.)
- Reason: 2–6 words (micro-excuse from AI pool)
- Closer: 1–3 words (Done. / Period. / Moving on.)

### Examples

✅ Good:

- "Pass. Calendar invited chaos. Done."
- "Nope. Brain entered airplane mode. Period."
- "Skip. Energy clocked out early. Moving on."

❌ Bad:

- "Today is not ideal for you." (too polite)
- "You might want to reconsider." (coaching tone)
- "It's okay to rest today." (wellness speak)

---

## Zodiac Flavor Rules

- **Only appears when a sign is selected**
- **Max 6 words**
- Short cosmic shrug; amplifies sarcasm
- Never explains or educates

✅ Good:

- "Virgo energy. Overthinking denied."
- "Mercury was involved."
- "Leo declined the request."

❌ Bad:

- "Because Virgo tends to overthink…" (explanation)
- "Mercury retrograde affects communication." (education)

## Strict Prohibitions

### ❌ NO Numerology

- No 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999
- Exception: Only if ironically used as joke

### ❌ NO Wellness Language

- "Let's try again tomorrow"
- "Take a break"
- "Align tomorrow"
- "Return tomorrow"
- "Pause and reflect"

### ❌ NO Astrology Jargon

- "Transits are intense"
- "Houses are blocked"
- "Phases are shifting"
- "Alignments are off"

### ❌ NO Therapy Speak

- "You need to…"
- "It's okay to…"
- "Consider your feelings…"

---

## Vocabulary Guidelines

### ✅ Preferred

- Pass, skip, nope, denied
- Out, closed, done, period
- Hard pass, final answer
- System error (as human metaphor)
- Message not delivered

### ❌ Avoid

- "The universe whispers"
- "Energies are heavy"
- "Cosmic alignment blocked"
- "Angel numbers guiding"

---

## Share Test (FINAL CHECK)

Before approving any message, ask:

**Would someone paste this into Slack, WhatsApp, or Twitter without embarrassment?**

If NO → reject it.

---

## Formula

`[Short refusal]. [Dry micro-reason]. [Conversation ender].`

Max 12 words. No emojis. No mysticism.
