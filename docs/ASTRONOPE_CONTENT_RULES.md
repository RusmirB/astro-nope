# AstroNope Content Rules

AstroNope = sarcastic excuse, not a horoscope.

## Core Identity

- Sarcasm is the product; cosmos is decor.
- Core reads like a decision: short, dry, confident.
- Zodiac is an optional twist, never required.

## Core Message Rules (Mandatory)

- 1–2 short sentences.
- Sounds like a verdict.
- Avoid emotions and explanations.
- No coaching, wellness, or advice.

Good:

- Not today.
- Can’t swing it.
- Hard no.

Bad:

- Today is not ideal for you.
- You might want to reconsider.
- It’s okay to rest today.

## Zodiac Flavor Rules

- Only appears when a sign is selected.
- Short cosmic shrug; amplifies sarcasm.
- Never explains or educates.

Good:

- Virgo energy.
- Mercury was involved.
- Leo declined.

Bad:

- Because Virgo tends to overthink…
- Mercury retrograde affects communication.

## Phrases to Avoid (Delete)

- Let’s try again tomorrow.
- Return tomorrow.
- Align tomorrow.
- Take a break.

## Formula

[Short refusal]. [Dry cosmic shrug].

Examples:

- Not today. Universe said no.
- Can’t swing it. Signals crossed.
- Hard no. Timing disagreed.
