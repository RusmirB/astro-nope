# AstroNope — Business Logic (Clean & Scalable)

## 1. Core Truth

AstroNope is a socially shareable excuse generator for modern burnout — an emotional vent + meme tool.

- Not horoscope, not serious astrology, not AI assistant, not productivity app.
- People use it to say “no” without explaining, with humor instead of justification.

## 2. Frictionless Flow

Shortest path to “haha” + share:

1. Open app
2. Get one message
3. Laugh
4. Copy / share
5. Leave
   No forms, minimal choices, no thinking > 5s.

## 3. One Message Per Day

- Exactly one deterministic daily message.
- Optional single twist.
- No infinite rerolls or lists.
- Encourages return tomorrow; keeps value special.

## 4. Balanced Control

- The app decides the message ("from the universe").
- The user decides the lens — how to experience it.
- Lens changes interpretation, not the core text.

## 5. Astrology As Theme

- Astrology = vibe/skin/inside joke, not prediction.
- Keep it playful; never earnest advice.
- Sign is never mentioned inside the core message.

## 6. Final Model

- Daily Cosmic Excuse: deterministic; same day → same message; “the universe decided”.
- Optional Zodiac Lens: OFF by default; when clicked, reinterpretation (flavor ending) without sign mention.
- No “Another One”; only “Tomorrow” and “Change lens”.

## 7. Share Is The Channel

- Share drives growth; message must be short, standalone, and clean.
- Ideal share text example: “Not today. The universe said no.”
- No extra branding or AI/astrology labels in shared text.

## 8. Monetization (Later)

- Monetize identity/ritual/status, not random or predictions.
- Only after users love the app, return, and share.
